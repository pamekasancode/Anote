# Anote
Anote is just like notepad that allows you to write anything but, the advantage its cross-platform so you can run in linux, macOS, Windows as long as you have:

Requirements:
1. Python 3.x
2. Pyinstaller (Optional, if you want to build in executable file)

I not recomend to use python2.x because this code is writen in python3.x version but, you can actually change it to python2.x Version
